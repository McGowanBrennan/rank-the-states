Rank the States is a game where you try to accurately guess the over/under of a state's population. 


## How to play:

1. A state and an over/under line will be provided to you
2. If you believe the state's population is OVER the given line, press OVER, if you believe it is UNDER the given line, press UNDER
3. Enter a precise guess as to what you believe the population is

You earn 1 point for correctly picking the over/under and 5 points for correctly guessing the precise population

## How it works:

Every time a user enters a guess, that info is pushed to a database and a new line will be calculated based on the average guess from all users
